# PeerPostie - peer-to-peer delivery

This is a project that was started during Hack the Crisis NZ 2020 aimed at finding innovative solutions to problems brought about by COVID-19.

PeerPostie is a peer-to-peer delivery service that helps you get anything picked up and delivered to and from your door by a neighbour or another local person.

## Run the project
To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`. The assets built by webpack are placed in `server/public`. This folder is defined as a static folder in an Express.js server that can be started with `npm run server`.

Additional components should be placed in `client/components`.

## Separate client/server

The client is also set up to be hosted using `webpack-dev-server` with hot module reloading etc. To use this method, in one terminal run:
```sh
npm run client
```
and in the other:
```sh
npm run server
```
The client will be available on http://localhost:8080 and the server on http://localhost:3000. Note that you will still need to manage CORS between the two, as they are on different ports.
